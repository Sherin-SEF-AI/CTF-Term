# CTF Terminal - Advanced Challenge Features

## üéØ Core Challenge Features

### 1. **Challenge Validation & Testing**
- `ctf validate-pack <pack.yml>` - Verify pack format and integrity
- `ctf test-challenge <id>` - Test challenge solve process end-to-end
- Flag format validation (regex patterns like `flag{[a-zA-Z0-9_]+}`)
- Auto-detect duplicate challenge IDs in packs
- Verify hint penalties are reasonable

### 2. **Challenge Dependencies & Prerequisites**
```yaml
challenges:
  - id: advanced-exploit
    requires: ["basic-buffer-overflow", "format-string-intro"]
    prerequisites:
      - "Complete basic-buffer-overflow first"
```
- Lock challenges until prerequisites are solved
- Show unlock requirements in challenge view
- Dependency visualization (graph view)

### 3. **Progressive Hints System**
```yaml
hints:
  - text: "Think about return addresses"
    penalty: 10
  - text: "Look at offset 40 bytes"
    penalty: 20
  - text: "The function address is 0x401156"
    penalty: 50
```
- Tiered hints with increasing penalties
- First blood gets no penalty
- Hint request logging (which hints were used)
- Smart hint suggestions based on solve time

### 4. **Challenge Timers & Deadlines**
- Per-challenge time limits (e.g., 1 hour challenge)
- CTF event duration tracking
- Time elapsed since first attempt
- Estimated time remaining
- Rush mode notifications

### 5. **Advanced Scoring System**
- **First Blood Bonus**: +10% points for first solver
- **Time Decay**: Points decay over event duration
- **Solve Streak**: Consecutive solves get multipliers
- **Category Mastery**: Bonus for completing all challenges in a category
- **Dynamic Difficulty**: Auto-adjust points based on solve rate

### 6. **Challenge Metadata & Tags**
```yaml
challenges:
  - id: xss-challenge
    tags: ["web", "injection", "beginner"]
    difficulty: "medium"
    estimated_time: "30 minutes"
    tools_required: ["burp", "browser"]
    skills: ["javascript", "dom-manipulation"]
```
- Filter by tags: `ctf list --tag injection`
- Difficulty indicators: ‚≠ê Easy | ‚≠ê‚≠ê Medium | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Hard
- Tool recommendations
- Skill requirements

### 7. **Solve Verification History**
- Track all attempts (successful & failed)
- Show attempt timestamps
- See which hints were used
- Failed attempt counter
- Streak tracking across challenges

### 8. **Challenge Templates & Generators**
- `ctf generate-challenge <type>` - Scaffold new challenge
- Templates for common CTF types (crypto, web, pwn, etc.)
- Sample test data included
- Auto-generated difficulty scores

### 9. **Challenge Bundle System**
```yaml
bundle: "OSCP Preparation"
challenges: ["buffer-overflow", "privesc", "linenum"]
unlock_order: true
total_points: 1000
```
- Group related challenges
- Sequential unlock (must solve in order)
- Bundle completion bonuses
- Track progress through bundles

### 10. **Flag Format Validation**
```yaml
flag_format: "^flag\\{[a-zA-Z0-9_]+\\}$"
flag_length: 20
```
- Custom flag regex patterns
- Length requirements
- Auto-validation before submission
- Format hints ("Your flag should look like flag{...}")

### 11. **Challenge Stats & Analytics**
- Solve rate percentages
- Average solve time
- Hint usage statistics
- First blood achievers
- Hardest/easiest challenges

### 12. **Offline Challenge Mode**
- Import challenge files (no internet needed)
- Validate solves locally
- Export results for later sync
- Air-gapped CTF support

### 13. **Challenge Difficulty Auto-Adjustment**
- Track how many attempts before solve
- Track average solve time
- Auto-adjust points based on actual difficulty
- Flag challenges as too easy/hard

### 14. **Challenge Verification Tools**
- Test flag verification locally before publishing
- Generate test cases
- Validate hint penalties work correctly
- Check challenge descriptions for typos

### 15. **Advanced Challenge Types**
- **Multi-stage challenges**: Solve A to get data for B
- **Chained challenges**: Output of one is input to next
- **Blind challenges**: No description, reverse it first
- **Puzzle challenges**: Cryptic clues leading to flag

### 16. **Challenge Search & Discovery**
- Full-text search: `ctf search "buffer overflow"`
- Fuzzy matching for misspellings
- Filter unsolved challenges
- Show recommended next challenges based on solved ones

### 17. **Solve Performance Tracking**
- Time to solve each challenge
- Number of attempts before success
- Which hints were needed
- Personal best times
- Improvement over time

### 18. **Challenge Archive**
- Archive old challenges
- Keep solved challenges for reference
- Create "practice sets" from archived challenges
- Restore archived challenges

### 19. **Challenge Testing Mode**
- Author can test challenges before publishing
- Temporary solve records (don't count in leaderboard)
- Test all flag variations
- Verify hints work correctly

### 20. **Enhanced Leaderboard**
- Filter by category
- Show solves per category
- Category-specific rankings
- Hall of fame (top solvers per challenge)
- First blood leaderboard
